# my_first_repository
this is the first time i'm creating a repository. i'm a professional student and my goal is to apply everything i learned.
from my vine1:
i'm currently studying at TAFE Granville and my goal is to become a Web Developer. I am enjoying the projects of being able to create something from codes and to run it and voila! it's a new website! i find it very fascinating and satisfying at the same time.
we currently did a test on html and i was very pleased that i actually enjoyed the exam. i got 24 of out 30 in my theory exam but i haven't heard my grade on the practical exam yet. but i did have some good indication that i did well as i wasn't told that i have to resit it. i am very fascinated as to how the coding of html can build tables and forms. we haven't even reached css or javascript yet but i am looking forward to the challenges of learning them too.
so at the moment, i'm a complete newbie at all this but i an enthusiastic about the possibilities of creating and developing websites.
the sql subject that we have is also excellent. i can follow the instructions BUT yes, it's a big BUT, i need more practice and problem solving. it really is practice practice practice. coding coding coding. and that's ok. i like doing it, i dont find it boring at all. i am looking forward to the school break where i can do some projects.
PHP is a total different beast. i am finding it difficult to internalise this language. i see how incredible it is and it has it's own merit to be used in a website... and at the moment, i can read it, but i can't write it down on my own. more understanding, more exposure to it, more and more practice.
so as you can see, this is the different stages i'm in, in my learning. i would appreciate your guidance, suggestions and feedback.
